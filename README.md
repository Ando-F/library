# library
Working on this projects I finally realised how objects work. Each book you can create is a separate object that can be modified. Also I guess I kind of mastered DOM, so from now on I can easily connect any JavaScript code to html elements. 

Project misses:
- Of course, it lacks good design, but it was not the goal.
- All the stuff user creates deletes on page refresh.
